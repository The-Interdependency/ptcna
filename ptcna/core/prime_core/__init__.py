"""prime_core — three-stratum PTCA core (tensor / circle / seed).

Public surface (handoff §2 MODULE_BUILD):
    build_core, CoreSpec

The stratification: scalar ``Fiq`` payloads are grafted into UCNS *circle*
carriers (opaque hosts) and composed into epicyclic *seeds*. Differentiability
descends to the scalar payloads; UCNS geometry is non-differentiable scaffold.

This package is independent of the published ``ptca-lib`` (flat 4-D tensor) and
does not modify it.
