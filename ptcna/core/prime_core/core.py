"""prime_core.core — the three-stratum PTCA core builder.

Stratification (handoff §1.1): scalar tensors are grafted into UCNS *circle*
carriers as opaque ``Fiq`` hosts, and circles are grouped into epicyclic
*seeds* (UCNS-in-UCNS). Routing IS the UCNS composition pattern, not an add-on:

    {7/2} heptagram composes tensors -> circle   (CIRCLE_ROUTING_STEP)
    {7/3} heptagram composes circles -> seed     (SEED_ROUTING_STEP)

Gradient policy (handoff §1.2): differentiability descends through the scalar
payloads; UCNS geometry (n_min, face state, anchor ordering) is
non-differentiable scaffold. ``compose_circle`` / ``compose_seed`` are the
structural ``⊠`` operator — they create no autodiff node, so ``∂(⊠)`` never
appears on the tape.
